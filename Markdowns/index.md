## Outline
This workshop is designed for biologists seeking to learn standard single-cell RNA-seq analysis techniques. 
The course emphasises droplet-based assays using 10X Genomics technology and covers the use of the Cell Ranger pipeline for read alignment and gene-level quantification. 
Participants will learn how to import count data into R, perform quality control, normalisation, data integration, clustering, and identify cluster marker genes. 
The workshop also addresses differential expression and abundance analyses. 
Additionally, attendees will gain experience in generating common visualisations, including t-SNE, UMAP, and violin plots, to interpret gene expression data.

## Data

* The course data is based on '[CaronBourque2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64929-x)'
  relating to pediatric leukemia, with four sample types, including:
  * pediatric Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells (PBMMCs)
  * three tumour types: ETV6-RUNX1, HHD, PRE-T  
* The data used in the course can be [downloaded from Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/9x1rg6qxqw5crq2vtb1ho/AMawguf1kqRYQQs-qZPhFZA?rlkey=6y4w1skyjzpq36zfyocis24t6&st=yyv0kusl&dl=0). Please note that:
  * these data have been processed for teaching purposes and are therefore not suitable for research use;
  * all the data is provided on our training machines, you don't need to download it to attend the course.


## Additional Resources

* [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/08-chap.html) - a fantastic resource to go deeper into some of the topics covered in this course. In particular chapter 8 of this book covers the statistical models for count data used in RNA-seq.
